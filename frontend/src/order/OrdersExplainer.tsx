      Orders are posted to the public order book and expire after a short time. Vanity nodes continuously scan the order
      book and try to pick up and execute orders on a bestâ€‘effort basis. Due to volume and order constraints, not all
      orders may be executed before they expire. Once an order is picked up, the node will create a new record in Golem
      DB and attach the results to it.
