          Orders are posted to the public order book and expire after a short time. Vanity nodes continuously scan the
          order book and try to pick up and execute orders on a bestâ€‘effort basis. Due to volume and order constraints,
          not all orders may be executed before they expire. Once an order is picked up, the node will create a new
          record in Golem DB and attach the results to it.
